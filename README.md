# BiteBuddy
BiteBuddy is an AI powered meal-planning tool that is prized for its customization. What this entails is that for every different user, a different meal plan is generated based on the user's preferences, needs, and dislikes. 

BiteBuddy uses OpenAI's latest GPT-3.5-turbo chat model to generate a customized weekly meal plan that satisfies the user's calculated target calories. The generated meal plan is very specific that it contains the nutritional content for each meal (Fats, Proteins, Carbs & Calories). Each meal also has an AI-generated recipe and ingredients list. Morever, using OpenAI's Dall-E 2 model, each meal has a generated AI image showing how the meal should look like.

This web application was built using React and a live version of it is hosted on the following link:
